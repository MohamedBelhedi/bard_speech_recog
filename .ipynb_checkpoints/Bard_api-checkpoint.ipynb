      "According to the sources I have reviewed, the electricity cost in Germany in 2024 is expected to be around €80-90 per megawatt hour (MWh). This is based on the assumption that the current energy crisis will have subsided by then and that the government's energy price brakes will remain in place.\n",

      "Of course, this is just a forecast and the actual price could be higher or lower. The factors that could affect the price include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The price of natural gas, which is a major input for electricity generation.\n",
      "* The level of renewable energy production in Germany.\n",
      "* The government's energy policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it is likely that electricity prices in Germany will remain higher than they were before the energy crisis. However, the government's measures to help consumers and businesses should help to mitigate the impact of these higher prices.\n",
